# FEV-tools
Fortran-written collection of tools to work with embedding tensors representing 3-regular graphs (analogous to 2D nanocarbon structures made solely of tricoordinated atoms). Deals with a simple .fev tensor format and with related .flg/.fcs formats associated to more complex entities describing the 3-regular graphs (flag graph/faces info set).
